TowerImac
=========

Game mixing Tower defense and Nanowars. Firstly developped with 3 friends, repo on bitbucket : https://bitbucket.org/Elfhir/towerimac

There is a runnable .jar if you want to try it.
If it doesn't work, try to compile it on Ecli≈ùe for instance.
No big deal, just a student done on a few days (IMAC engineering school)

Licence totally free of use (Beerware Licence)
